FROM HENI CENSUS TRACT DISPARITY LITERATURE 

multilevel modeling framework ; premature mort rates are sig higher in more impoverished areas

lots of within neighborhood variation in premature mort; decreased after adjusting for CT poverty 

"populatoin attributable fraction analysis" shows that in some of Boston's poorest neighborhoods, 25-30% of premature deaths were assoc w CT poverty 

mort data from mass dept of public health ; then deaths were geocoded w 97% successful matches at the CT level 

premature mort : death before age 75 

neighborhoods were defined by the boston public health commission - a total of 16 neighborhoods were included in the study 

categorized CT poverty into 4 levels 

multilevel analysis: age groups nested within CTs within neighborhoods 

used \~ten year age groups - total of 9 groups 

models: poisson mixed effects models 

m1: age and spatial random effects 

m2: age, spatial random effects, CT poverty

incidence rate ration (IRR) was estimated for each CT relative to the lowest poverty category (SO THE BOTTOM IS REFERENCE IN THIS CASE???) 

contribution of CT and neighborhood var was estimated using random effects variance components 

bayesian 

I DONT UNDERSTAND THIS PART

models were fit w bayesian inference w markov chain monte carlo (MCMC) estimation 

winbugs package w 70k iterations, 10k burnin and thinning by 30 

model fit assessed using deviance informatoin criterion (DIC) 

standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were mapped at CT and neighborhood levels showing premature mort rates relative to boston average (IN THIS CASE THE TOTAL AVERAGE WAS THE REFERENCE???) 

model based direct std rates were calcd to adjust for age dist allowing comparisons w external mort rates 

population attributable fraction (PAF) was estimated to determine the prop of premature deaths linked to living in high poverty CTs 

bayesian modeling: 

used to stabilize small area estimates 

allows for spatial smoothing - can incorporate random effects at both the CT and neighborhood levels 

bayesian credible intervals provide direct probabilistic statements about parameter estimates ; esp useful for estimating incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and mortality risk differences across CTs 

## Sociodemographic disparities in e-cigarette retail environment: Vape stores and census tract characteristics in Orange County, CA

<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2017.12.004>

Georgiana Bostean, Luis Sanchez, Adam M. Lippert

vape stores within a single county 

23.4% of CTs had at least 1 vape store; more prevalent in areas w higher percentage of hisp residents, lower pop density, and more tobacco retailer density 

when controlling for tobacco retailer density, poverty was no longer a significant factor 

clustering of nicotine related buisness 

vape stores may be targeting or disprop appearing in communities w ses vulnerabilities 

vape store location - compiled thru systematic internet search 

total of 173 vape stores identified and geocoded 

ground truthing for a subset of 36 stores to verify accuracy 

tobacco retailer locations - obtained from CA state board of equalization 

SES and land use data from the ACS 5 year est : race/eth, nativity, edu, poverty, age dist 

land use: orange county public works; used to estimate the percent of commercial land use in each CT 

"zero-inflated poisson regression" models to analyze the relationship between vape store counts and neighborhood chars (must be bc most cts don't actually have vape stores) - also called a ZIP model :) 

predicted outcome: count of vape stores in CTs where at least one store exists 

relationship between vape store count and SES 

higher vape store incidence rates in CTs w higher hisp pop, greater tobacco retailer density, lower pop density ; commercial land use sig decreased prob of a tract having no vape stores

is CT SES associated w survival of prostate cancer?? 

retrospective cohort of Black and White men in 4 chicago area medical centers 

concentrated disadvantage (CD) As a multidim SES indicator ; calcd from 1990 census data 

survival analysis using cox proportional hazards models, adj for demographics, tumor chars, treatment, health care system 

higher disadvantage -\> lower prob of survival 

racial disparities disappeared after adjusting for SES (THIS IS USEFUL!!!) 

the effect of SES on survival was sig in private sector patients but not in the VA system - equal access health care system (VA) might mitigate the impact of SES on survival 

Concentrated disadvantage CD = percent in poverty + percent unemployeed + percent female headed households + 100 - percent college grads 

excluded racial composition from original formula to avoid collinearity 

CD is useful because it is not analogous to individual SES (such as income or edu) but instead reflects broader neighborhood level economic and social conditions (kinda like our cluster value....) 

CD is predictive of health outcomes, including self rated heatlh and asthma

census tract poverty levels and HIV rates 

unadj HIV rates are assoc w poverty 

after adjusting for percent black, percent male, percent unmarried, percent unemployment, percent vacant housing, the relationship between HIV and poverty was less clear 

initially examined crude (unadj) HIV rates, then adjusted them for sociodemographic factors

examined all 298 CTs in milwaukee county ; focused on CT level analyses 

poisson regression: dependent var was HIV cases; used log of populatoin as an offset in all models 

separate models for black, white, all pop 

black individuals have higher HIV rates across all poverty levels 

low number of HIV diagnoses

focused on Milwaukee county

two methods:

weighted model - captures disparity between tracts ONLY ; cannot account for within tract differences; effectively a point estimate of health weighted by population size ; no margins of error

simulated model: incorporates point estimate and margin of error for each measure; within CTs estimates are roughly drawn from normal dist until a "simulated" population the same size of the original CT is met ; therefore we can
