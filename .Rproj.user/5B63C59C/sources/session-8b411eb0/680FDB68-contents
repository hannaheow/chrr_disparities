## March 5, 2025 

-   how does Jun summarize his comparisons and his findings from various models/methods in the simulation paper? are there other papers of Jun's that are relevant / might spark ideas?

-   Should we assess income disparities instead since they are the largest? but are census tract disparities an appropriate proxy since they are more readily available? more clearly defined?

-   Work towards abstract deadline for APHA March 27

-   put results on p drive

-   clarify partial corr discordance with multiple regression - this will inform next steps

-   decomposition of thiels index - not useful yet...

## Feb 2, 2025 

-   Clarify the research question

    -   What are census tract disparities capturing?

    -   What has been done to capture disparities using CT level data previously? 

    -   If we measure disparity at the CT level, how much disparity in other domains are we capturing? 

    -   For now, we are not interested in incorporation of disparity into ranks / clusters; that is a separate research question. 

-   Analyze data: P:\\CH-Ranking\\Research\\Disparity Measurement\\Census Tract Disparity Measurement

    -   Initial thoughts:

        -   regression with CT level disparity as a covariate to "adjust" a relationship between a well-established health factor and a health outcome (or cluster) 

            -   This will tell us how much of the relationship between income (for example) and health can be explained by CT disparities ; could do the same with edu and/or race (though race is not ideal because we would probably have to pick just one) 

        -   Regression with CT level disparity as an outcome with income and race as predictors 

            -   This will tell us if income or race disparities is a stronger predictor of census tract disparities  

    -   Decomposition - find more info in the cancer disparities paper 

        -   Can we decompose CT disparities into race and income components ? 

-   Run analyses by Ron? Paul? Amy?
