Just notes so far

papers to read: messer 2008, harper 2008, firebaugh 2003

white paper output notes/questions:

-   within reach: census tract disparities for 5 measures of length and quality of life - what are these 5??

-   a dozen subgroup disparity metrics were eval'd using ct level data for self reported fair/poor health and life expectancy - need to figure out which dozen disparity metrics and also why these two vars

-   narrowed down the metrics by comparing county ranks based on performance in various metrics but ranks only deviated by less than 5 from the avg rank across metrics (this is a lil confusing but i think this is saying that regardless of method, the ranks don't change if/when we account for disparity? how exactly was disparity accounted for? ) can i find this code???

-   pop avg as reference pt - can't discern direction easily

-   inequality aversion - heavily weight large departures from reference; need to be careful if pop weighted to avoid over emphasizing extreme disparities in small reference groups

-   pop weighting - almost always good

-   relative v absolute - absolute are easier to communicate / act on; best if combined w a measure of overall health (like a rank adjustment)

-   absolute: bgv relative: theils, mean log deviation (MLD) ; theils more heavily weights the deviation from the mean while mld more heavily weights pop

-   proportion CTs: need a min of 2 in order to use our methods - 93% of counties have at least 2 CTs ; no evidence that counties w few CTs are biased

-   HIGHLIGHTED: need analyses on the assoc between CTs and other social groups of interest (race, edu, income) ; what measures of assoc or methods to use to do this? (this is the q keith asked me to do lit review on!!!)

-   weighted mean of CT versus weighted SD of CT - is this population weighted???

-   check out the harvard geographic insights and the inequality adjusted human development index

justification of census tracts

health equity quadrants

heni's paper

jun's analyses which compare disparity - ask elizabeth for these drafts (there are 2 papers)

strategic implementation and how to communicate

how to include in rankings

mostly need to make a lot of decisions and justify them / compromise

#This folder contains county-level BGV and Thiels for income, race, and tract ; also contains SD  of the BGV

disp_income = disp_income %>% rename(bgv_income = bgv, theil_income = theil)
disp_race = disp_race %>% rename(bgv_race = bgv, theil_race = theil)
disp_tract = disp_tract %>% rename(bgv_tract = bgv) #no theil here for some reason


dispt = merge(disp_race, disp_tract, by = c("statecode", "countycode"))
disptot = merge(dispt, disp_income, by = c("statecode", "countycode"))
disptot_sub = disptot %>% 



corrplot::corrplot(cor(disptot))
```

Based on the reading in Heni's folder

-   simple regression models between disparities and some other measure of health (cluster??)

-   correlation between each of these disparity metrics themselves

-   model between poverty (or some other well established and simple metric - could be income, edu, etc) and health and "adjust" for the disparity (ie as a covariate)

    -   model between income and health (cluster) and adjust specifically for income disparity

        -   then we can say that the relationship between income and health is XXX explained by disparities in income

    -   model between edu and health (cluster) and adjust for race disparity

        -   then we can say that the relationship between edu and health is xxx explained by racial disparities (hmmmm maybe not so useful )

        -   

specific question = if we measure disparity at the CT level, how much disparity in other domains are we capturing

this table: P:\CH-Ranking\Research\Disparity Measurement\Census Tract Disparity Measurement\\2024 Digging Deeper Table_04252024.xlsx ; tab: Field Comparison_6 Disagg

homeownership was decided to be pilot measure because no modeling, no income already included

decomposition of disparities!!! need to find this in the cancer disparities paper

is it okay to measure disparities at the CT level and what else are we capturing with these metrics?
